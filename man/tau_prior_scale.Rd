\title{Compute Scale Parameter for a Weakly Informative Half-Normal Prior for Tau}
\usage{
tau_prior_scale(extreme_value)
}
\arguments{
\item{extreme_value}{Numeric value (must be positive) representing the 97.5th percentile of a normal
distribution whose standard deviation is the 95th percentile of the half-normal prior for τ. This
value is considered a "surprisingly large" benchmark, indirectly informing the prior’s scale.}
}
\value{
The scale parameter (`scale`) of the half-normal distribution.
}
\description{
This function calculates the scale parameter (σ) of a half-normal distribution to be used as a
weakly informative prior for the heterogeneity parameter (τ) in Bayesian random-effects meta-analysis.
The prior is designed such that the 95th percentile of the half-normal distribution serves as the
standard deviation of a normal distribution, and the user-specified `extreme_value` represents the
97.5th percentile of that normal distribution. This approach ensures that the prior for τ allows for
plausible heterogeneity while linking to a broader context of effect size variation, making extreme
heterogeneity values unlikely.
}
\details{
In a meta-analysis, τ represents the standard deviation of true effect sizes across studies. By
setting the `extreme_value` as the 97.5th percentile of a normal distribution with standard deviation
equal to τ’s 95th percentile, the prior indirectly controls the plausible range of heterogeneity,
ensuring that 95% of τ values are below `extreme_value / z_0.975` (where z_0.975 ≈ 1.96 is the
standard normal’s 97.5th percentile).
}
\examples{
# Example: Set an upper limit of 10, implying τ’s 95th percentile is ~5.1
tau_prior_scale(extreme_value = 10)

# Example: Set an upper limit of 5, implying τ’s 95th percentile is ~2.55
tau_prior_scale(extreme_value = 5)
