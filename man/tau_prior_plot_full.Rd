\title{Plot a Weakly Informative Half-Normal Prior for Tau and Corresponding Normal Distribution}
\usage{
tau_prior_plot_full(
  extreme_value,
  fill_color = "#D1A14F",
  text_color = "white",
  xlabel,
  inner_color = "orange",
  tail_color = "gray90"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{extreme_value}{Numeric value (must be positive) representing the 97.5th percentile of a normal
distribution whose standard deviation is the 95th percentile of the half-normal prior for tau.
This is a "surprisingly large" benchmark that indirectly informs the prior’s scale.}

\item{fill_color}{Character string specifying the fill color for the area under the half-normal
curve up to its 95th percentile (default: "#D1A14F", a light orange).}

\item{text_color}{Character string specifying the color of the text annotation for the probability
in the half-normal plot (default: "white").}

\item{xlabel}{Character string specifying the x-axis label for the normal distribution plot.}

\item{inner_color}{Character string specifying the fill color for the 95% probability region in
the normal distribution plot (default: "orange").}

\item{tail_color}{Character string specifying the fill color for the tails outside the 95%
probability region in the normal distribution plot (default: "gray90").}
}
\value{
A patchwork object combining a ggplot2 plot of the half-normal distribution and a ggplot2
  plot of the corresponding normal distribution.
}
\description{
This function generates two plots for a Bayesian random-effects meta-analysis:
1. A plot of a half-normal distribution used as a weakly informative prior for the heterogeneity
   parameter (tau), which represents the standard deviation of true effect sizes across studies.
2. A plot of a normal distribution whose standard deviation is the 95th percentile of the
   half-normal prior, with the user-specified `extreme_value` set as its 97.5th percentile.
}
\details{
The half-normal prior is defined such that its 95th percentile is `extreme_value / z_0.975`, where
z_0.975 ≈ 1.96 is the standard normal’s 97.5th percentile. This ensures that 95% of the prior
probability for tau lies below `extreme_value / z_0.975`, making extreme heterogeneity unlikely while
allowing plausible variation. The `extreme_value` represents a "surprisingly large" value in the
context of a normal distribution (e.g., effect sizes), where the standard deviation equals tau’s
95th percentile, and `extreme_value` is the 97.5th percentile of that normal distribution. This links
the prior for tau to a broader context of effect size variation.

The half-normal plot highlights key statistics (median, 95th percentile, and 99th percentile).
The normal distribution plot shows the distribution of effect sizes with mean 0 and standard
deviation equal to tau’s 95th percentile, with the 95% probability region shaded and `extreme_value`
marking the 97.5th percentile.

# Plot the prior and normal distribution with extreme_value = 10

# Use different colors
tau_prior_plot_full(extreme_value = 5, fill_color = "lightblue", text_color = "black",
