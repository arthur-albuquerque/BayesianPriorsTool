\title{Plot a Normal Distribution Prior for Mu with User-Specified Mean and SD}
\usage{
mu_dist_viz(
  mean,
  sd,
  prob = 0.95,
  scale = c("absolute", "relative"),
  xlabel,
  inner_color = "orange",
  tail_color = "gray90"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mean}{Numeric value for the mean of the distribution (must be positive if `scale = "relative"`).}

\item{sd}{Numeric value for the standard deviation of the distribution (must be positive).}

\item{prob}{Numeric value between 0 and 1 specifying the quantile interval probability (default is 0.95).}

\item{scale}{Character string specifying the scale: `"absolute"` (default) or `"relative"`.}

\item{xlabel}{Character string for the x-axis label; must be provided by the user (e.g., "Odds Ratio").}

\item{inner_color}{Character string specifying the fill color for the inner quantile interval (default is "orange").}

\item{tail_color}{Character string specifying the fill color for the tails outside the quantile interval (default is "gray90").}
}
\value{
A `ggplot2` object representing the normal distribution plot.
}
\description{
Creates a density plot of a normal distribution for the overall effect parameter (mu) in Bayesian
random-effects meta-analysis, using a user-specified mean and standard deviation. The plot highlights
a quantile interval (default 95%) and supports both absolute and relative (log) scales.
}
\details{
This function is useful when users have prior knowledge of the mean and standard deviation for mu
and want to visualize the resulting prior distribution. For example, effect sizes like odds ratios
or risk ratios are analyzed on the log scale (termed "relative" scale), while mean differences or
standardized mean differences are on the "absolute" scale.
}
\examples{
# Absolute scale plot
mu_dist_viz(mean = 0, sd = 1, xlabel = "Mean Difference")
# Relative scale plot (log scale)
mu_dist_viz(mean = 1, sd = 0.5, scale = "relative", xlabel = "Odds Ratio")
# Custom probability
mu_dist_viz(mean = 2, sd = 1.5, prob = 0.9, xlabel = "Effect Size")
